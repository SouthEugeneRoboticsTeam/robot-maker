# Robot Maker

Robot Maker is a tiny command line utility that makes creating yearly
game repositories super easy. It bases the new code off of the
[Robot-Base](https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/Robot-Base)
repository and updates everything that needs to be changed. All you
have to do is push the code!

_Only tested on macOS at the moment._

## Usage

```bash
./robot-maker.sh <path_to_robot> <game_name>
```

For example...

```bash
./robot-maker.sh ../PowerUp-2018 PowerUp
```

This command will create a new repository with all the robot code
you'll need to get started.
